# SecretSanta
Python script to assign a secret santa to each participant and sending them an email

The source code should provide enough information to start the app, however there are two example files provided in this repo.
You'll need to edit these first (a notepad editor is sufficient, as long as it is not the shitty one from MS).
Also, set up your gmail account: you need to enable 2 factor authentification and generate an app password. You cannot use the 'allow less secure apps' option anymore...

To start this, type 'python -m SecretSanta wishlist.csv template.txt'
